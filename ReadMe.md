# FAtiMA Toolkit Starter Kit

The objective of this Unity Project is to help newcomers to FAtiMA Toolkit to learn how to use it.

Additionally if developers want to build and improve upon this project feel free to do so. It is a good starting point for any FAtiMA-powered project.

Beware that this uses the LFS system to save most of the large sized-files.
